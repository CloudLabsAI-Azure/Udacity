## Getting Started
1. Click on the **ACCESS LAB** button. Wait until the Cloud Lab VM loads (this could take up to 5 minutes) 


2. You can use the Cloud Lab VM either in the classroom or use the generated RDP credentials to connect from your local machine. Go to the **Lab Environment** tab next to get Azure login credentials and Environment details (RDP/SSH credentials). 
     - For Windows machines, you will get Remote Desktop Connection credentials.
 

## Getting Help
- If you have a technical problem while using your VM, you can send an email to Udacity Support at [udacity-labsupport@udacity.com](mailto:udacity-labsupport@udacity.com). 
- Please be sure to send your message from the email you used to enroll in the Nanodegree program. Use the following email template:   
     - Subject Line: Error in <Lab name>
     - Timestamp and Timezone:
     - Brief description of what you were doing when the issue occurred: 
     - Screenshots:

     
## Restrictions 
- Cloud Lab's session time is limited. Your session will expire after the validity expires, and you will lose all your resources in the temporary Azure account. 


- Later, when you come back or refresh the Cloud lab page, you will get a new VM with a new pair of temporary credentials.
